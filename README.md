# Yaoma Storytellers (Standalone)
## Introduction

Residing primarily in the globular star cluster known as **The Tianting**, the **Yaoma** are a group of hermaphroditic xenohumans closely related to and otherwise visually indistinguishable from baseliners. They originated from a prosperous glitterworld, designed by the first of them: their mythologized hero-king known as **Ku**. From their **Jade Progenitor**, they have received a sacred mission to ensure greater humanity’s survival against the archotechs. Whether said mission is warranted- another story.

Among them are those that have traversed the full breadth of **Yaoma cultivation**, a psycho-transhumanist method for transcendence of the human mind and body. They are known as **immortals**. **Immortals** represent the most honored and powerful of the **Yaoma**, capable of altering the natural world with their comprehension of the **Dao**, a metaphysical gestalt schema managed by the xenotype. By applying said laws with the usage of **qi**, the motive force of the universe, the **Jade Sisters** hope to stand against the transcendent machines.

Of these **immortals**, at least three of them have more than a passing interest in storytelling. Their experiences, comprehensions, and capabilities shape the tales that they tell to such an extent that natural law bends to them.

Survive their challenges, and you just may seize victory against the archotechs.

## Storytellers
### Farseer Fan

*“Follow, divert, resist your flowing time- let the stars witness your fate.”*

**Farseer Fan** will grant you visions of the future to come: you'll know what incidents will occur in advance. In exchange, she only asks to challenge you, increasing the difficulty of negative events as well as the frequency of incidents in general. Such is the price of knowing capricious fate, as the stars decreed.

### Kaiyi the Karmic

*“Significant customer lifetime value. Expect new capital.”*

**Kaiyi the Karmic** appreciates a good deal. Random negative events payout karma, which can be spent to purchase beneficial or neutral events when negotiating with Kaiyi. Only negative events you have chosen grant their full karma, though, and event prices follow demand. Take care not to become a debtor, lest he employs some… reconciliation services.

**Kaiyi** also reserves the right to increase incident frequency, influence certain incidents with the weight of karma, and adjust the prevalence of negative events; otherwise, he lets fate run its chaotic, random course.

### Deathless Daji

*“Courting death? I married her!”*

**Deathless Daji** will resurrect all corpses at the end of the day- why should death be the end of all things? That doesn’t mean no risks, though: every resurrection she performs rots revived pawns with the dreaded **Crimson Psychosis**, maiming their mental stability. At full mind-blight, they’ll become berserk husks for eternity. 

Beyond that, he is a fervent believer of living in the moment, throwing in whatever event catches her fancy.
